Termsharp is a feature-rich VT100 terminal emulator widget, written in C#.

It is developed as part of the [Renode](https://www.renode.io) emulation framework.

Termsharp relies on the [XWT UI toolkit](https://github.com/mono/xwt).

Termsharp supports a fairly complete VT100 command set.
It also implements [iTerm2 protocol for handling inline images](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html).
